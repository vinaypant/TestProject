Pipes let us render items in component templates in the way we want.

There are two kinds of pipes in Angular—pure and impure pipes. A pure pipe is a pipe that is
run when a primitive JavaScript input value like strings, numbers, booleans, symbols or an object 
reference change.

Pure pipes must be pure functions. Pure functions take an input and return an output. 
They don’t have side effects. Changes within objects are ignored with pure pipes. When any 
changes take place, the pipe will run and the latest change will be rendered.

Impure pipes are pipes that can detect changes within objects and arrays.

--------------
Pure pipes are the pipes which are executed only when a “PURE CHANGE” to the input value is detected.

So impure pipe executes everytime irrespective of source has changed or not. 
which leads to bad performance. thats why it is not recommneded to use pipes for filtering data.
